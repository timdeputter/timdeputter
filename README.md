Hi, my name is Tim, I'm a software developer living in Emden, which is located at the beautiful north sea coast of germany.

The majority of code I have written was in C#, Java, Javascript, Ruby, C and C++. I took my first steps in languages like Pascal and Basic in the mid 1990s and dipped into functional programming in Elixir/Erlang, as well as Haskell, purescript and elm a few years ago.
I'm also into test driven development, domain driven design and simple design.

For most of my sideprojects I like to let vscode suck the ideas out of my brain, but I'm also not reluctant to ide's. For my dayjob this is mainly MS Visual Studio, but in the past I have made some experience with other ides (like intellij or eclipse) too.

When I'm not writing code I like to do sports like weightlifting in my homegym. I love traveling with my beautiful wife Steffi and sometimes I just have a beer (maybe some more) with my friends.
