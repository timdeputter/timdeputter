Hi, my name is Tim. I am a software developer who resides in Emden, a city located on the breathtaking North Sea coast of Germany.

I have primarily written code using C#, Java, Javascript, Ruby, C, and C++. In the mid 1990s, I began learning languages such as Pascal and Basic, and more recently, I have delved into functional programming using Elixir/Erlang, Haskell, Purescript, and Elm. I am also interested in test-driven development, domain-driven design, and simple design.

In my spare time, I often turn to Visual Studio Code to inspire and guide my side projects. However, I am also comfortable using a variety of IDEs. For my day job, I primarily use Microsoft Visual Studio, but I have also had the opportunity to work with other IDEs such as IntelliJ and Eclipse.

When I am not coding, I enjoy weightlifting in my home gym. I also relish the opportunity to travel with my beautiful wife, Steffi, and occasionally, I enjoy a beer (maybe some more) with friends.
